It is always hard to choose what exact cosmetic product do you want and is suitable for you, so we are here to help! Based on your preference and your skin type, we help to select the best suitable product for you, no matter what product you want, cleanser or moisturizer, and what brand you prefer, La Mer or Murad. This book analyzes 1472 products of 6 types and 116 brands, from which you can easily get the information you want on the products you are interested in and compare them to other products. 

We provide analysis about features of products of different attributes such as different prices, ranks and so on. We are dedicated to answer the following questions:

* Are there any differences in number and price of each product for different skin types? If so, what caused these differences? 
* Are there any differences in ingredients for products of different price levels and skin types?
* Is there any relationship between rank and price among brands? If not, what reasons do you think lead to the results?

We make recommendations on:
* Given skin type and product type, recommend the top one product to customers. 
* Based on your skin type, we help to list all the suitable products for your preferences of productsâ€™ features.
