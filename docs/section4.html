<p>We need to get a sense of what chemical ingredients are used in our daily-used products before making a selection. We make comparisons between products labeled with different price and designed for different skin types.</p>
<div id="top-10-ingredient-rank" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Top 10 Ingredient Rank</h2>
<p>We try to figure out the top 10 chemical ingredients in cosmetics with low, medium, and high price. We rank the ingredients by their frequencies. If two chemical ingredients have same frequencies, we rank them by alphabetical order. We classify the price lower than the median as low price, the price greater than median but lower than 75% quantile as medium price and the price greater than 75% quantile as high price.</p>
<center>
<img src="img/summary.png" />
</center>
<p>The above table provides summary statistics for the dataset. By our classification rule, products with price lower than $42.5 are considered to be low-price products. Products with price between $42.5 and $68 are medium-price products and those with price higher than $68 are high-price products.</p>
<p>The following table reveals that the products in different price levels share a lot of frequently-used ingredients. One difference we realized is that products with high prices use Glycerin the most, as glycerin attracts water to itself. It helps to leave your skin with an overall moisturizing and smoothing effect.</p>

<p>Next, we would also like to explore Top 10 ingredients in products for different skin types. The following table gives an overall sense of ingredients for each skin types.</p>

<p>There is no much difference between the Top 10 ingredients in products among skin types. However, we can clearly notice that the frequencies of some ingredients are different.</p>
<ul>
<li>In sensitive skin, the ingredients Butylene Glycol and Dimenthicone are higher frequently used than other skin type.<br />
</li>
<li>The ingredient Xanthan Gum is most frequnetly used in the products for oily skin.<br />
</li>
<li>Among the products of all skin type, the ingredient Sodium Hyaluronate is only shown up in oily skin and sensitive skin, which implies that oily skin and sensitive skin might require some ingredients that different from the rest of skin types. Or, this ingredient adds more credits to the oily skin and sensitive skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following topics will focus on unique ingredients in products based on prices and skin type, which will further lift the veil of skin care products.</p>

<p>Among the top 100 chemical ingredients, we want to find out what the most commonly used unique ingredients in products with low, medium, and high price are.</p>
<center>
<img src="img/ingredients_venn_diagramm.png" alt="Ingredient Venn Diagram" style="width:60.0%" />
</center>
<p>From the Ingredient Venn Diagram, we found that there are many (67) ingredients that are used by products of all prices, which could be considered as basic ingredients for cosmetics products. For products of each pair of the three groups, they share several ingredients with another pair. Products with high prices and low prices seem to share the least common ingredients.</p>
<p>There are 17, 12, and 16 unique ingredients in products with low, medium and high price repectively. The following tables shows these unque ingredients. Scroll down to look at all the ingredients if you are interested ðŸŒ·.</p>

<p>Some ingredients unique in high-price-level products are natural ingredients or the ingredients that are a bit difficult to be extracted from, which makes those products more expensive. For example, Laminaria Digitata is one of the unique ingredients in this category.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Laminaria Digitata</strong>:
It is a natural ingredient extracted from oarweed or tangleweed in the sea. It can solely absorb its nourishment from the sea, which makes it a very valuable ingredient. Rich in vitamins, minerals, amino acids and trace elements, it can be used for food and cosmetics products. The function of the ingredient in skin care is to promote healthy and youthful skin and enhance the appearance of luminosity.</li>

<p>From the above diagram, we can see that most ingredients are shared by products for all skin types. There are few intersection bsetween some pair of products. Also, there are 4 unique ingredients in products for sensitive skins and 1 unique ingredient for products for each of dry, oily, combination skins.

<!-- We found that there are one unique ingredient for each of combination, dry, and oily skins. There is no unique ingredient for normal skins and there are four unique ingredients for sensitive skins. -->
<!-- Look at the description for each of these ingredients -->
<!-- **Combination Skins** -->
<!-- - **Urea**: Urea is used to prevent the change in the acid/base balance of a product when it is mixingly used with other products. It also slows the loss of moisture of a product.^[https://cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/urea-0] -->
<!-- - **Why unique in products for combination skins**: Since people with combination skins use products of different effects, Urea could prevent the ingredient of these products from being contaminated and help each product get the most out of its effects. -->
<!-- **Dry Skins** -->
<!-- - **Ceteareth-20**: Ceteareth-20 is used as a penetration enhancer in cosmetics products. It can alter the skin structure so that the moisture could go deeper into the skin.^[https://thechalkboardmag.com/toxic-tuesday-ingredient-focus-ceteareth-20] -->
<!-- - **Why unique in products for dry skins**: Obviously, since dry skins lack moisture, Ceteareth-20 efficiently add moisture to the deep of the skins. -->
<!-- **Oily Skins** -->
<!-- - **Isododecane**: Isododecane makes the products spread easily without leaving a thick or greasy residue and helps the customers feel "weightless" skins.^[https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/isododecane#benefits] -->
<!-- - **Why unique in products for dry skins**: People with oily skins usually have greasy appearances. When they apply cosmetic products on their skins, they often feel their skins overwhelmed. Isododecane can effectively reduce people's feel of "weight" on their skins. -->
<!-- **Sensitive Skins** -->
<!-- - **Aluminum Hydroxide**: Aluminum Hydroxide protects skins from harmful stimuli and may provide relief to the skins. -->
<!-- - **Why unique in products for sensitive skins**: Sensitive skins are unstable. They are easily affected by stimuli in the environment and thus resulting in reactions such as redness. Aluminum Hydroxide serves as a protectent so that skins are not affected by damaging stimuli.^[https://thechalkboardmag.com/toxic-tuesday-ingredient-focus-ceteareth-20] -->
<!-- - **Curcuma Longa(Turmeric) RootExtract**: It allows anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activity, which successfully reduce acne in the skins. It might also regulate sebum production.^[https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/curcuma-longa-root-extract] -->
<!-- - **Zinc Gluconate**: Zinc Gluconate serves as an antiviral agent for acne treatment. It could also assist the body in processing nutritions for healing to speed wound healing and prevent scarring.^[https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/zinc-gluconate] -->
<!-- - **Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract**: It can eliminate puffiness from under the eyes by stimulating circulation. Rosemary reduces redness, swelling, acne and blemishes and thus restores skinâ€™s natural elasticity. Antioxidants in rosemary could slow down aging.^[https://www.afterglowcosmetics.com/rosemary-for-natural-beauty-2/] -->
<ul>
<li>The result of the unique ingredients is the same as what we expect. From the graph at the section <a href="section3.html#section3_3">3.3</a>, it is concluded that more unique special ingredients are used for sensitive skin type. The result here also corresponds to the conclusion. The ingredients commonly used in other skin type might not be suitable for senstivie skin, which will probably lead to skin intolerance, irritation and other untoward effects.<br />
</li>
<li>Each unique ingredient of each skin type matches the features of skin type. The following descriptions in the flip cards clarify the reasons.</li>
