But obviously, there are generally less products for sensitive skins of all the product types! This is because Generally, sensitive skins are less common than other skin types It may require special ingredients to produce products for sensitive skins, which may cause potentially more efforts to develop and produce related products. Sensitive skins are easily affected by stimuli in the environment and skin-care products. People should be very careful when developing products for sensitive skins, which could also result in more efforts. Moist- urizer and face mask are two peak demands for each skin type since they satisfy basic skin care, and most of these products targets to all skin type. ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸Detailed analysis of different ingredients within different products will show in next section Top Ingredients. 3.3 Price Differences for Each Skin Type Good news for people with less common and sometimes troublesome skin types: There arenâ€™t much difference in prices for each skin type ðŸŽ‰! You do not need to pay more to have your skin problems solved. However, obviously, there are significant differences in prices between different types of products. Treatment products are set to be more expensive since they contain many more effective ingredients. They are highly demanded and and are typically used in a daily bases. Cleansers are the cheapest, since there is no necessary to add expensive and effective ingredients in them. It is enough to have cleansers clean well and do no damage skins. We always think eye creams are very expensive, but the prices of eye creams are lower than expected. This is because the amount of eye cream in a product is very low while the unit price (such as the price per gram) is very high. ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸Detailed analysis of different ingredients within different products will show in next section Top Ingredients.

["section4.html", "Chapter 4 Top Ingredients 4.1 Top 10 Ingredient Rank 4.2 Unique Ingredients in Products", " Chapter 4 Top Ingredients We need to get a sense of what chemical ingredients are used in our daily-used products before making a selection. We make comparisons between products labeled with different price and designed for different skin types. 4.1 Top 10 Ingredient Rank We try to figure out the top 10 chemical ingredients in cosmetics with low, medium, and high price. We rank the ingredients by their frequencies. If two chemical ingredients have same frequencies, we rank them by alphabetical order. We classify the price lower than the median as low price, the price greater than median but lower than 75% quantile as medium price and the price greater than 75% quantile as high price. The above table provides summary statistics for the dataset. By our classification rule, products with price lower than $42.5 are considered to be low-price products. Products with price between $42.5 and $68 are medium-price products and those with price higher than $68 are high-price products. The following table reveals that the products in different price levels share a lot of frequently-used ingredients. One difference we realized is that products with high prices use Glycerin the most, as glycerin attracts water to itself. It helps to leave your skin with an overall moisturizing and smoothing effect. Next, we would also like to explore Top 10 ingredients in products for different skin types. The following table gives an overall sense of ingredients for each skin types. There is no much difference between the Top 10 ingredients in products among skin types. However, we can clearly notice that the frequencies of some ingredients are different. In sensitive skin, the ingredients Butylene Glycol and Dimenthicone are higher frequently used than other skin type. The ingredient Xanthan Gum is most frequnetly used in the products for oily skin. Among the products of all skin type, the ingredient Sodium Hyaluronate is only shown up in oily skin and sensitive skin, which implies that oily skin and sensitive skin might require some ingredients that different from the rest of skin types. Or, this ingredient adds more credits to the oily skin and sensitive skin. The following topics will focus on unique ingredients in products based on prices and skin type, which will further lift the veil of skin care products. 4.2 Unique Ingredients in Products 4.2.1 Unique Ingredients based on Prices Among the top 100 chemical ingredients, we want to find out what the most commonly used unique ingredients in products with low, medium, and high price are. From the Ingredient Venn Diagram, we found that there are many (67) ingredients that are used by products of all prices, which could be considered as basic ingredients for cosmetics products. For products of each pair of the three groups, they share several ingredients with another pair. Products with high prices and low prices seem to share the least common ingredients. There are 17, 12, and 16 unique ingredients in products with low, medium and high price repectively. The following tables shows these unque ingredients. Scroll down to look at all the ingredients if you are interested ðŸŒ·. Some ingredients unique in high-price-level products are natural ingredients or the ingredients that are a bit difficult to be extracted from, which makes those products more expensive. For example, Laminaria Digitata is one of the unique ingredients in this category. Laminaria Digitata: It is a natural ingredient extracted from oarweed or tangleweed in the sea. It can solely absorb its nourishment from the sea, which makes it a very valuable ingredient. Rich in vitamins, minerals, amino acids and trace elements, it can be used for food and cosmetics products. The function of the ingredient in skin care is to promote healthy and youthful skin and enhance the appearance of luminosity. 4.2.2 Unique Ingredients based on Skin Type From the above diagram, we can see that most ingredients are shared by products for all skin types. There are few intersection bsetween some pair of products. Also, there are 4 unique ingredients in products for sensitive skins and 1 unique ingredient for products for each of dry, oily, combination skins. Curious about what these unique ingredients are and their uses? Scroll down and you can find the answer! The result of the unique ingredients is the same as what we expect. From the graph at the section 3.3, it is concluded that more unique special ingredients are used for sensitive skin type. The result here also corresponds to the conclusion. The ingredients commonly used in other skin type might not be suitable for senstivie skin, which will probably lead to skin intolerance, irritation and other untoward effects. Each unique ingredient of each skin type matches the features of skin type. The following descriptions in the flip cards clarify the reasons. Flip the card and look at the descriptions! body { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .flip-box { background-color: transparent; position: ; width: 600px; height: 240px; border: 1px solid #f1f1f1; perspective: 1000px; } .flip-box-inner { position: relative; width: 100%; height: 100%; text-align: center; transition: transform 0.8s; transform-style: preserve-3d; } .flip-box:hover .flip-box-inner { transform: rotateY(180deg); } .flip-box-front, .flip-box-back { position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; backface-visibility: hidden; } .flip-box-front { background-color: #ffb3b3; color: white; font-size: 20px; } .flip-box-back { background-color: #ffe6f0; color: white; transform: rotateY(180deg); } .text-front { font-family: 'Fredoka One', cursive; } .text-back-title { font-family: 'Fredoka One', cursive; } .text-back-content { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono', monospace; color: #ac3939; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; } Urea Combination Skin Urea Urea is used to prevent the change in the acid/base balance of a product when it is mixingly used with other products. It also slows the loss of moisture of a product. Since people with combination skins use products of different effects, Urea could prevent the ingredient of these products from being contaminated and help each product get the most out of its effects. Ceteareth-20 Dry Skin Ceteareth-20 Ceteareth-20 is used as a penetration enhancer in cosmetics products. It can alter the skin structure so that the moisture could go deeper into the skin. Obviously, since dry skins lack moisture, Ceteareth-20 efficiently add moisture to the deep of the skins. Isododecane Oily Skin Isododecane Isododecane makes the products spread easily without leaving a thick or greasy residue and helps the customers feel \"weightless\" People with oily skins usually have greasy appearances. When they apply cosmetic products on their skins, they often feel their skins overwhelmed. Isododecane can effectively reduce people's feel of \"weight\" on their skins. Aluminum Hydroxide Sensitive Skin Aluminum Hydroxide Aluminum Hydroxide protects skins from harmful stimuli and may provide relief to the skins. Sensitive skins are unstable. They are easily affected by stimuli in the environment and thus resulting in reactions such as redness. Aluminum Hydroxide serves as a protectent so that skins are not affected by damaging stimuli. Curcuma Longa(Turmeric) Root Extracts Sensitive Skin Curcuma Longa(Turmeric) Root Extract It allows anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activity, which successfully reduce acne in the skins. It might also regulate sebum production. People with sensitive skins may suffer from different problems. Curcuma Longa(Turmeric) Root Extract can effectively reduce some of them. Zinc Gluconate Sensitive Skin Zinc Gluconate Zinc Gluconate serves as an antiviral agent for acne treatment. It could also assist the body in processing nutritions for healing to speed wound healing and prevent scarring. Sensitive skins are easily to be damaged. Zinc Gluconate can efficiently acclerate the healing process! Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Sensitive Skin Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract It can eliminate puffiness from under the eyes. Rosemary reduces redness, swelling, acne and blemishes and thus restores skinâ€™s natural elasticity. Antioxidants in rosemary could slow down aging. Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract can reduce redness efficiently as well as provide nutritions. "],
["section5.html", "Chapter 5 Rank", " Chapter 5 Rank The average prices and the average rank for each brand of the products are demonstrated in the following scatter plot. There seem to be no obvious relationship between price and rank among brands. However, we still find something noteworthy. LA MER sets its price to highest class among other brands. It is probably because that some of the ingredients have higher cost in extracting from raw materials and fusing into the finished product. Also, those high-cost ingredients might achieve more remarkable results on skin improvement. However, BIOEFFECT has similar price range as LA MER but has higher ranking. The products containing EGF specially EGF serum and EGF eye serum are best sellers in official website of BIOEFFECT. EGF, Epidermal Growth Factor, is a 6-kDa protein with 53 amino acid residues and three intramolecular disulfide bonds. This ingredient gives largest credits to the products as it stimulates cellsâ€™ revive by replacing aging and dying cells to achieve the function of anti-aging. For LA MER, its products work better on skin repairing rather than anti aging. The higher ranking of BIOEFFECT than LA Mer might imply that the demand of anti aging of customers is greater than skin repairing or there is other brand working better on skin repairing but with lower prices than LA MER. The one with highest ranking is CLARISONIC. The featured products are skin care devices such as face brushes which is not including in our data. Its cleanser gel or cream work best with its own skin care devices, and are at lower prices with average $19. Its highest ranking fully demonstrates its product effect. We keep DERMAFLASH whose ranking is 0 in the graph is because we would like to present the information of all brands. The reason why there is no rank for DERMAFLASH might be that the featured product of this brand is skin care device which is not included in our dataset. Also, they seldom sell the products of the skin care cream/gel. In conclusion, the products with higher prices do not guarantee its higher ranking, and some products can also achieve similar effects on skin at lower prices. The ranking does not solely depend on the price of product, since customers usually have different demands and preferences. Also, packing design and marketing promotion of products possibly make difference to the ranking. "],

["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitations 7.2 Future Directions 7.3 Lessons Learned", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Limitations There are limited number of brands and products in our datasets. Many products are not included in the dataset, so people who are interested in other products may feel our project not very helpful. The data was scrapped only from Sephora, thus the sample size may not be large enough. So there are some cases that only a few people ranked a certain product, which may cause bias. The explanation in the skin section may not be complete. For example, we said that there are a few reasons for less products for sensitive skins such as there are less people with sensitive skins. But there might be more reasons. For the ingredients part, we have many ingredients left without explanation of their uses, so users may need to search for their uses by themselves. We only used tables for the results in the ingredients part, maybe we could consider a better visualization way. For the top 1 recommendation part, there are a few products with the same highest rank, but we let R choose a fixed one to recommend. We could improve the feature by randomizing top 1 product to recommend. After recommending the product, we do not provide further information besides basic information such as brand, price and so on. For the product recommendation part, the results we have are tables, which may not be ideal to visualize the results. We didnâ€™t find a way to change the style of headers, so they seem a little bit unfit to the overall style of the project. 7.2 Future Directions More data will be needed to explore more comprehensive topics of skin care. There are many other ways to get more data including scrapying from websites and looking for any existing outresources online. More interesting topics can be covered in the future. For example, what is the distribution of customers with specified skin types, and is there any relationship between skin type of people and the residential location (involving local weather, humidity and pressure). 7.3 Lessons Learned There are always many unexpected bugs/problems, so we should start earlier next time. Update your progress with your teammates on time in case they are working on the same part. "],
